    "options": [
      "Visit FEMA's Flood Map Service Center to know types of flood risk in your area. However, remember that flooding doesn’t follow lines on a map. Where it can rain it can flood. Sign up for your community’s warning system. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio also provide emergency alerts. The National Risk Index is an easy-to-use, interactive tool that shows which communities are most at risk to natural hazards like flooding.",
      "Ignore flood warnings",
      "Purchase or renew a flood insurance policy. Homeowner’s insurance policies do not cover flooding. It typically takes up to 30 days for a policy to go into effect so the time to buy is well before a disaster. Get flood coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).",
      "Assume that your area is not part of flood risk zone",
      "Make a plan for your household, including your pets, so that you and your family know what to do, where to go, and what you will need to protect yourselves from flooding. Learn and practice evacuation routes, shelter plans, and flash flood response. Gather supplies, including non-perishable foods, cleaning supplies, and water for several days, in case you must leave immediately or if services are cut off in your area."
